**autotestR** is an R package designed to simplify the execution of the main statistical tests commonly used in the life sciences. It provides user-friendly functions that automatically generate plots and clear explanations, making statistical analysis more accessible for researchers and students.

## Installation

You can install the development version of autotestR directly from GitHub:

```r
# Install devtools if you don't have it yet
install.packages("devtools")

# Install autotestR from GitHub
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Luiz-Garcia-R/autotestR.git")
```

# Main features

- t test (independent and paired)
- Mann–Whitney test (Wilcoxon rank-sum)
- Multiple group comparison (t test or Mann–Whitney)
- Chi-squared test and Fisher’s exact test
- One-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test
- Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn post hoc test
- Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation tests with automatic plots
- Diagnostic function that suggests the most appropriate statistical test
- Intuitive plots fully integrated into the functions


### Basic usage

```r
library(autotestR)

# Independent t test
group1 <- rnorm(30, 10, 2)
group2 <- rnorm(30, 12, 2)
test.t(group1, group2)

# Chi-squared test
var1 <- sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE)
var2 <- sample(c("Yes", "No"), 100, replace = TRUE)
test.chi(var1, var2)

# Multiple test (t test or Mann–Whitney)
df <- data.frame(
  control   = rnorm(30, 10),
  treatment = rnorm(30, 12),
  test1     = rnorm(30, 11),
  test2     = rnorm(30, 15)
)
test.tmulti(df)

# ANOVA with post hoc test
g1 <- rnorm(20, 5)
g2 <- rnorm(20, 7)
g3 <- rnorm(20, 6)
test.anova(g1, g2, g3)

# Correlation test
x <- rnorm(30)
y <- x + rnorm(30, 0, 1)
test.correlation(x, y)
```
